1. Create a short script to automatically create/modify playbooks for new users. For the moment I will assume that we will default the shell to bash, and that we will set the UIDs starting from 10000 and incrementing per additional user. This should take the following parameters:
  a. Username
  b. SSH key
  c. Password (no echo, will be crypted)
2. Create a short script to list users based on playbooks.
3. Create a short script to delete (set absent) users (their playbook entry would remain but with a state of absent).
4. Create a short script to edit a user.

The playbook when created should consist of:
1. User resource:
  a. name = ${Username}
  b. password = crypted(${Password})
  c. shell = /bin/bash
  d. state = present
  e. uid = ${prev uid} + 1
